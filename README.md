<h3>Reporting</h3>
<p>If you are being harassed by a member of COMMUNITY NAME, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the RESPONSE TEAM at [email address or other contact point]. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.</p>

<p>This code of conduct applies to COMMUNITY NAME spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of COMMUNITY NAME outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by COMMUNITY NAME members, especially LEADERSHIP TEAM, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from COMMUNITY NAME based on their past behavior, including behavior outside COMMUNITY NAME spaces and behavior towards people who are not in COMMUNITY NAME.</p>

<p>In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.</p>

<p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of COMMUNITY NAME members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>

<h3>Consequences</h3>
<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, RESPONSE TEAM may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all COMMUNITY NAME spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other COMMUNITY NAME members or the general public.</p>
